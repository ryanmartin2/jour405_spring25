title: "Volleyball Percentiles"
---

We'll be calculating percentiles to see how good Maryland was in service aces in the 2024 season. We'll use `mutate()` and a new function `ntile()` to calculate percentiles. Get started by loading the tidyverse in a code block, then load the CSV file here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensVolleyballData/refs/heads/main/data/ncaa_womens_volleyball_matchstats_2024.csv" and save it to a dataframe called `matches`.

### Task 1: Load the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


### Task 2: Load the data

```{r}
matches <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensVolleyballData/refs/heads/main/data/ncaa_womens_volleyball_matchstats_2024.csv")
```

### Task 3: Create totals of aces for each team using `group_by()` and `summarize()`

```{r}
team_aces <- matches |> 
    group_by(team) |> 
    summarize(total_aces =sum(aces)) |> 
    arrange(desc(total_aces))
```


### Task 4: Calculate percentiles using `mutate()` and `ntile()`

```{r}
team_aces |> mutate(pecentile = ntile(total_aces, 100))
```


### Task 5: Describe the percentiles

Write a couple of sentences that puts Maryland into context with the other teams in the dataset. You can do some Internet research to help with this.

This dataset puts into context where Maryland ranks among all D1 programs in terms of service aces. As Derek said today in class, it it much easier to realize how impressive Maryland is at service aces when you put the data into a percentile instead of saying they are "The 17th best SA team in the country". 95th percentile is much more impressive and gives a much better understanding of how 17th in the country with 343 teams present is very impressive. The dataset also allows us to easily see how Maryland has the most SA out of any B1G team.


When you are done, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.
